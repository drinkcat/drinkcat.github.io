Some musings of drinkcat, a.k.a. Nicolas Boichat. I used to be a
Software Engineer at Google, in Taiwan, for 8 years. I first
worked on Chrome OS, doing various board bringups for about 6 years,
then dipped into management for the Silicon team (Tensor SoC) for
the last 2 years. I'm now on a career break, travelling a bit, and
trying to figure out my next step(s).

I used to have a [blog](https://drinkcat.blogspot.com/) a long time
ago, before my time at Google. Mostly about photography, then some
Chromebook/[crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) stuff.
Not quite sure what this one is going to be about, but I had a
couple of small-ish interesting(?) projects that I thought I could
write up about.
