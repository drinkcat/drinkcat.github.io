Some musings of drinkcat, a.k.a. Nicolas Boichat, a software engineer
on a career break after working in big tech for almost a decade.

I used to have a [blog](https://drinkcat.blogspot.com/) a long time
ago. Mostly about photography, then some Chromebook/[crouton](https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton) stuff.
Not quite sure what this one is going to be about, but I have a
couple of small-ish interesting(?) projects that I thought I could
write up about.
